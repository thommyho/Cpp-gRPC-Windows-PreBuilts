## Highlights

Prebuilt libraries and required header files packaged in archives.

- For several modern Visual Studio Compilers:
  - Visual Studio 2015 - `MSVC 140`
  - Visual Studio 2017 - `MSVC 141`
  - Visual Studio 2019 - `MSVC 142`
- For both `32- and 64-Bit architectures`
- Convenient with all three build configurations `Release`, `RelWithDebInfo`, `Debug`

What is code without examples - harder to understand, less practical to get stated with, and so on.

- Several easy starter examples from the official gRPC project
  - For `Visual Studio 2015`, `Visual Studio 2017` and `Visual Studio 2019`
  - `Pre-configured` - Can be used in seconds.
  - `Debuggable` - `RelWithDebInfo` and `Debug` include symbols

## Requirements

One of the compilers:

- Visual Studio 2015 - `MSVC 140`
- Visual Studio 2017 - `MSVC 141`
- Visual Studio 2019 - `MSVC 142`

For a better experience use one of the IDEs with one the upper mentioned compilers.
